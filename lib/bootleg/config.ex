  Defines a role.

  Roles are a collection of hosts and their options that are responsible for the same function,
  for example building a release, archiving a release, or executing commands against a running
  application.

  `name` is the name of the role, and is globally unique. Calling `role/3` multiple times with
  the same name will result in the host lists being merged. If the same host shows up mutliple
  times, it will have its `options` merged. The name `:all` is reserved and cannot be used here.

  `hosts` can be a single hostname, or a `List` of hostnames.

  `options` is an optional `Keyword` used to provide configuration details about a specific host
  (or collection of hosts). Certain options are passed to SSH directly (see
  `Bootleg.SSH.supported_options/0`), others are used internally (`user` for example, is used
  by both SSH and Git), and unknown options are simply stored. In the future `remote/1,2` will
  allow for host filtering based on role options. Some Bootleg extensions may also add support
  for additional options.

  Defines a before hook for a task.

  A hook is a piece of code that is executed before/after a task has been run. The hook can
  either be a standalone code block, or the name of another task. Hooks are executed in an
  unconditional fashion. Only an uncaught exeception will prevent futher execution. If a task
  name is provided, it will be invoked via `invoke/1`.

  Just like with `invoke/1`, a task does not need to be defined to have a hook registered for
  it, nor does the task need to be defined in order to be triggered via a hook. Tasks may also
  be defined at a later point, provided execution has not begun.

  If multiple hooks are defined for the same task, they are executed in the order they were
  originally defined.

  ```
  use Bootleg.Config

  before_task :build, :checksum_code
  before_task :deploy do
    Notify.team "Here we go!"
  end
  ```

  Relying on the ordering of hook execution is heavily discouraged. It's better to explicitly
  define the order using extra tasks and hooks. For example

  ```
  use Bootleg.Config

  before_task :build, :do_first
  before_task :build, :do_second
  ```

  would be much better written as

  ```
  use Bootleg.Config

  before_task :build, :do_first
  before_task :do_first, :do_second

  Invokes the task identified by `task`.

  This is one of the cornerstones of the Bootleg DSL. Executing a task first calls any registered
  `before_task/2` hooks, then executes the task itself (which was defined via `task/2`), then any
  registered `after_task/2` hooks.

  The execution of the hooks and the task are unconditional. Return values are ignored, though an
  uncuaght exception will stop further execution. The `task` does not need to exist. Any
  hooks for a task with the name of `task` will still be executed, and no error or warning will be
  emitted. This can be used to create events which a developer wants to be able to install hooks
  around without needing to define no-op tasks.

  `invoke/1` executes immediately, so it should always be called from inside a task. If it's placed
  directly inside `config/deploy.exs`, the task will be invoked when the configuration is first
  read. This is probably not what is desired.

  Executes commands on a remote host.

  This is the workhorse of the DSL. It executes shell commands on all hosts associated with
  the `role`. If any of the shell commands exits with a non-zero status, execution will be stopped
  and an `SSHError` will be raised.

  `lines` can be a `List` of commands to execute, or a code block where each line's return value is
  used as a command. Each command will be simulataneously executed on all hosts in the role. Once
  all hosts have finished executing the command, the next command in the list will be sent.

  `filter` is an optional `Keyword` list of host options to filter with. Any host whose options match
  the filter will be included in the remote execution. A host matches if it has all of the filtering
  options defined and the values match (via `==/2`) the filter.

  `role` can be a single role, a list of roles, or the special role `:all` (all roles). If the same host
  exists in multiple roles, the commands will be run once for each role where the host shows up. In the
  case of multiple roles, each role is processed sequentially.

  Returns the results to the caller, per command and per host. See `Bootleg.SSH.run!` for more details.
